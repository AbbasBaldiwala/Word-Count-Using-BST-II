I agree with Professor Falcon and believe that Congress has become too partisan because it is more focused on Democrats vs. Republicans rather than actually solving problems.
The impact of this increase in partisanship is that fewer laws are passed because the two sides are too busy stopping each other. 
In addition, congress members who are supposed to represent the population of people who voted them in, end up just siding with either party and going with their agenda. 
This hinders progress because if Congress is split close to 50/50, then both sides will just use their power to stop the other side from passing anything that they don't fully agree with.
Congress is supposed to represent the people of the United States, but they just end up representing either Republicans or Democrats. 
Maps showing red or blue on different states do not represent the voters accurately because they just put everyone under the umbrella of either Republican or Democrat when in reality, people might have different ideas. 
Congress has almost always been divided into two major parties, but the division should be about ideas instead of parties. 
When members of Congress are basically forced to vote with their party, they may not accurately represent the people who voted for them.
