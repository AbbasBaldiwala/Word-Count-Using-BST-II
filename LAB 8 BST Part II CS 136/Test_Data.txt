  agree      professor falcon     believe      congress     become     partisan because            focused    democrats     republicans rather      actually solving  problems
    impact         increase    partisanship         fewer          passed because         sides              stopping       other 
    addition congress members         supposed    represent     population    people     voted                      siding      either party     going      !!!!!  agenda 
     hinders progress because    congress    split close                     sides               !!!!! power             other           passing anything                 fully agree      
congress    supposed    represent     people        united  states                      representing either republicans     democrats 
     showing                different states        represent     voters accurately because               everyone under     umbrella    either republican    democrat          reality people might      different  ideas 
congress     almost always      divided          major  parties         division should    about ideas instead     parties 
     members    congress     basically forced              !!!!!  party              accurately represent     people     voted
